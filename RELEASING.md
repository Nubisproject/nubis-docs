# Nubis - Relase Managment

This is a document that helps explain all the process involved in Release Managment for the Nubis project. If you are not planning to make a Nubis release, you can safely ignore this document, unless you are curious.

## Milestones

Milestones are used to track a given Nubis release. Issues that will be part of that relase will be assigned to the corresponding Milestone.

### Format

All Milestones will be [semantic versions](http://semver.org/) in the form of vn.n.n, where v stands for 'v'ersion, as per GitHub's recommended naming practices.

There can also be an extra postfix to the version number, added to describe the type or release this represents, i.e.

 * v1.0.0-beta
 * v1.2.3-devel
 * v1.5.5-preview

 ### Code names

 Release code-names might be exist, but will be used for purely cosmetic purposes. The *Happy Panda* release would just be a name for the v1.5.0 release.

## Tags

Tags will be used to track releases of the Nubis Project.

All tags will be [semantic versions](http://semver.org/) in the form of vn.n.n, where v stands for 'v'ersion, as per GitHub's recommended naming practices.

All tags will be [GPG Signed](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) by the Release Manager, allowing anybody to verify their integrity.

Each Nubis repository is allowed to follow it's own minor release tagging schedule.

Major release bumps (i.e, from v0.9.2 to v1.0.0) will be coordinated across all repositories, to provide a consistent versionning scheme for each major Nubis Project release.

## Changelogs

Each repository will contain a CHANGELOG.md document, highlighting the changes between releases. It's a very common pattern
for software projects. However, maintaining ChangeLogs can quickly become tiresome.

To address this, all ChangeLogs for Nubis will be generated by [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator) during the release process.

The process is really simple and will look like this:

    $> github_changelog_generator --future-release v1.0.0 nubisproject/nubis-docs

## Cadence

For the time being, minor releases will not be on a schedule. They will be the responsability of the respective
repository members, and we encourage the mentality of release often, release early.

Major releases, since they require coordination between repositories, will be less frequent. However, we are not
ready yet to commit to a specific time-based cadence. Major releases will happen organically, as we define and complete
the milestones for them.

## Announcing

Sometimes, like when making a new release, it can be desired to reach all Nubis Users. The current day-to-day mechanism to communicate with Nubis users is on the #nubis-users channel on irc.mozilla.org

However, for more official announcements, or information that needs more reasonable delivery guarantees than IRC, we use the [nubis-announce](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/nubis-announce) distribution list. It can be reached at [nubis-announce@googlegroups.com](nubis-announce@googlegroups.com)
