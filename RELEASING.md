# Nubis - Relase Managment

This is a document that helps explain all the process involved in Release Managment for the Nubis project. If you are not planning to make a Nubis release, you can safely ignore this document, unless you are curious.

## Milestones

Milestones are used to track a given Nubis release. Issues that will be part of that relase will be assigned to the corresponding Milestone.

### Format

All Milestones will be [semantic versions](http://semver.org/) in the form of vn.n.n, where v stands for 'v'ersion, as per GitHub's recommended naming practices.

There can also be an extra postfix to the version number, added to describe the type or release this represents, i.e.

 * v1.0.0-beta
 * v1.2.3-devel
 * v1.5.5-preview

 ### Code names

 Release code-names might be exist, but will be used for purely cosmetic purposes. The *Happy Panda* release would just be a name for the v1.5.0 release.
