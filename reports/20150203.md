# Nubis progress report for 20150203

This is the first of what should be weekly status report on the progress of the
Nubis effort at Mozilla. Longer than usual, since this is the first **ever**

This week is all about preparation for the upcoming Sprint. We've been hard at
work putting together the remaining bits to hit our interal goal of delivering a
working sample application on top of the Nubis infrastructure.

We've picked dpaste for it's simplicity and yet, it's a mature application that
could be used at Mozilla.

We aren't there yet, but are confident we'll have it up and running before the
Sprint.

We are also working on many fronts, as is usual:

* Finishing up a VPC design recommendation with dcurado (gozer)
* Starting to flesh out the user-story for a new Nubis project onboarding
* Starting to work an AMI registry (digi)
* Thinking about security and thread models
* Thinking about secret distribution, after great conversations with secops

## Components
